# Remove Tracking Parameters
Removes specified tracking parameters from URL and redirects (e.g., utm_source, ysclid, fbclid .....)

This plugin helps you remove URLs with parameters from Search Console using 301 redirects.
Website owners notice that Search Console indexes all combinations of URL parameters. Google can index thousands of combinations of them.
These are duplicates that degrade page rankings.
Canonical tags should help, but it will take some time before they are all processed because the pages will have to be rescanned.
One way to speed up the resolution of this error is to use a 301 redirect from a URL that contains parameters to a URL without parameters.
